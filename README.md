# Vaccine preparation tray

## The problem
The fight against the Covid-19 pandemic continues and countries are setting up vaccination strategies to protect their population. Many hospitals and vaccination centres worldwide are dealing with challenges of setting-up a fast, efficient, and safe vaccination plan.  

One of the challenges is the preparation of the vaccine syringes. Covid-19 vaccines are delivered in vials containing 6 to 11 doses, depending on the producer of the vaccine. Doses from the vial need to be drawn up into syringes, so that one syringe can be used to vaccinate one patient. 

To speed up the vaccination process, preparation of the vaccine syringes is done by the pharmacy and injection of the vaccine is done by a nurse or physician. This means that the vaccine syringes need to be transported from the pharmacy to the location where the vaccine is administered. It is also necessary to keep track of which vaccine (producer and lot number) every patient receives. That is why correct labelling of transported vaccines is particularly important.  

At the moment, hospitals and vaccination centres often use so-called ‘kidney dish’ to collect and transport syringes. Kidney dishes are used for various medical applications; however, this bowl is not always the best solution. Syringes are mixed up which makes it difficult to take out one, because of this, precious time is lost, and it can lead to administering errors. Healthcare organisations were looking for a better alternative to transport the vaccine syringes. 

## The design
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](https://img.youtube.com/vi/rdpCua8XM-c/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdpCua8XM-c "ADF - Vaccin tray design"){:target="_blank"}

- It fits all syringes we so far have seen selected for COVID-19 vaccine applications. Ranging from 6 to 11 mm diameter and volumes of 1 to 2 ml.
- The Tray is designed to hold the syringes of one vial of Moderna vaccine (11 doses), one vial AstraZeneca vaccine (8 to 10 doses) and two vials of Pfizer vaccine (two times 6 doses).
- Trays are securely stackable, both filled with syringes and empty. Empty trays nest into each other, this way saving space. 
- The general dimensions of the tray are roughly an A4 in size and 2 cm tall. This size should fit most actively used fridges or trolleys conveniently. 
- On both sides is a flat surface foreseen to place a label of the specific vial brand, batch and details.
- The central surface of the tray can be used to place branding in the form of a logo or a sticker.

## The benefits
- Syringes nicely organized.
- Safe transportation.
- Easy to count and keep track of.
- Traceability from vial to patient.
- Quick check of volumes in each syringe.
- Re-usable by cleaning it with IPA or dish-washing it with soap.
- Securely stackable.
- Easy to take out syringes at the patients side. 
- Prevents from a accidently pushing in any plungers 

## Material choice:
### For the mould:
- We advise using high-temperature, high density polyurethane tooling foam for this application 
- Organizations with experience can use their materials of choice for the mould.
- MDF might also be suitable, but might break after a few uses since the design contains thin-high pieces. 
- 3D printing may also be a good choice. But SLA printer are preferred over FDM prints since the layer steps on FDM make the trays hard to clean.

### For the tray:
- PETG or Vivak is advised as a medical choice and provided a decent amount of stiffness. It can be vacuum formed well and can stand cleaning with IPA and soaps. 
    - A thickness of 1mm is advised to have a decent strength.
    - In PETG there are not many colour options. So clear PETG is the best option.
- PP would be the second best pick because of again its medical purpose. But is a lot harder to form well whilst vacuum forming. The material needs to be at the exact optimal temperature and often warps if not done perfect. 

## How to make it
The tray is designed to be vacuum formed out of 1mm PETG or PP. This means a mould must be made first to form the plastic sheet over.

1. The mould is milled out of a solid piece of this foam using a CNC mill.
1. The mould needs extra ventilation holes to allow air to be pulled out of the cavities. This is done with thin long drills of around a millimeter in diameter. In our mould we drilled about 50 holes in corners and deep parts.

1. The mould also needs lubrication to allow the plastic sheet to release with ease. We applied a thin coat of Vaseline, but silicone release sprays would work as well. This release agent does need to be cleaned off of the tray after forming before use.
1. In the design branding in the form of a 3D logo is left out since these small features might be hard to mill. Thus these can be added at this moment as thin 3D printed pieces.
Also two arrows are placed at this moment to help visualising what label fits with that side of the trays syringes in case the vial holds 6 doses or less.
1. Remove the protective foils from both sides of your plastic sheet.
1. Depending on your machine you first place the mould or place the sheet of plastic. But in general words prepare the machine and pre-heat the sheet of plastic.
1. As the sheet hits around 150°C (after about 30sec) it should be ready to be pulled over the mould. 
1. Let it cool down on the mould until the plastic has hardened again.
1. Take out of the machine and pull out the mould from the tray. Blowing in compressed air from the sides may help with the pop.
1. The tray is now left with a brim that can be cut off using a sharp blade, a bandsaw, a grinder of any other tool that you prefer. The cutting edge is foreseen as a flat rim that can be cut easily on the table.
1. Remove sharp edges with a file or sanding paper.
1. Clean the tray before use to remove the release agent and dust.
